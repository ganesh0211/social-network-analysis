abe Plotkin spent the first half of January defending his hedge fund’s portfolio from a Reddit mob, the second half trying to convince investors he can survive a 53% loss, and early February explaining to Congress what happened.
Now with the public spectacle subsiding, the most concrete sign is emerging yet that his Melvin Capital Management might actually manage to thrive anew. After adjusting strategy, Plotkin pulled off an almost 22% gain in February, about eight times the return of the S&P 500.
So starts the most arduous part of the 42-year-old hedge fund manager’s bid to climb out of the hole left by January’s clash, in which retail investors organized on social media to drive up stocks such as GameStop Corp. that Melvin and others had bet would fall. The episode cost his investors -- including billionaire Steve Cohen, Brown University and the Robin Hood Foundation -- more than $6 billion.
But even with the rebound, Plotkin’s fund, which had $8 billion at the start of February, will need to produce an additional 75% gain for earlier clients before they break even and start paying fees again. Investors who have stuck by or piled into the firm are betting he’ll be able to do that given his track record, which ranked him as one of the best stock pickers until this year.
Last month’s performance was especially welcome for investors who decided to pony up a collective $250 million at the beginning of February -- likely seeing it as an opportunity to increase their exposure to a hedge fund that had been closed to new capital. The firm now manages $10.9 billion, including February’s gain and money that came in on March 1.
That vote of confidence followed a late-January investment by Ken Griffin, his partners and his Citadel hedge funds, and Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, which together gave the firm $2.75 billion in exchange for a three-year minority piece of Melvin’s revenue. The deal came together in a matter of hours.
