A hedge fund is a form of alternative investment that pools capital from individual or institutional investors to invest in varied assets, often relying on complex techniques to build its portfolio and manage risk. Hedge funds can invest in anything from real estate to currencies and other alternative assets; this is one of many ways in which hedge funds differ from mutual funds, which normally only invest in stocks or bonds.

The aim of all hedge funds is to maximise investor returns and eliminate risk, regardless of whether the market is going up or down.

Their popularity is often attributed to the US bull markets of the 1920s, prior to the great depression. Today, hedge funds have several trillion dollars are under management.
